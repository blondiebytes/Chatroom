# Chatroom
A basic chatroom application that employs a GUI client and a multi-threaded server. The chatroom can be run and accessed on a single computer as well as multiple computers. If you want multiple computers to talk to each other in the same chatroom, you must change the field host in the ChatClient class to InetAddress.getByName("Put-IP-Address-Here") instead of InetAddress.getLocalHost(); To find the IP address of a computer, you can type ifconfig in the command line and find the line that says inet and copy down the IP address. An example of an IP address would be 194.66.82.11, so it should look like that. For the chatroom to work between computers (i.e. running the ChatClient on several computers), all instances of the ChatClient must have the same host.
